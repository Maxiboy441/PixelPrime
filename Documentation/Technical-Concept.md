# Technical Concept: PixelPrime

## Overview
The project uses an API to retrieve movies that users can rate and add to their favorites. Users can also add movies to a “watch list” and receive recommendations from our AI server.

## Features
- Search for movies
- Rate movies
- Top Rated Movies List
- Movie Recommendations
- User Profile
- Login/Register
- Statisics
- Watchlist
- Movie info page (+ movie trailer)
- Comments to movies

## Architecture
The project is made in C# MVC

### Front-end
- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- C#
- Bootstrap

### Back-end
- C# MVC

### Database
- MySql container

### Database Modell

### External Services/APIs
- Movie API: 
https://www.omdbapi.com/

> ℹ️ **Info:** Everytime a Rating is mentioned in the project, its NOT the one from the api, rather it is our internal rating. If you ever have to display the rating of movies, you unsure of they're rated, look it up in the db (if there is non, show "Not rated")


## Security Considerations
- user auth
- server behind a firewall and revers proxs

## Deployment and Hosting
Hosted on [Maximilian Huber](https://github.com/maxiboy441)'s home server which is based on debian.

## Infrastructure diagramm 
![Alt text](./diagramms/infrastructure_diagram.png)
TODO: Decide if we want to deploy on bare metal or via docker like [this](https://github.com/users/Maxiboy441/projects/14?pane=issue&itemId=65759519) suggests.

## Future Enhancements
- Use of AI features (recommendations with diffrent weighting) api: api.webai.maxih.de

### Used Packages
- ASP.NET Core Identity: For handling user authentication and authorization.
- Entity Framework Core (EF Core): For database interactions and ORM capabilities.

### Recommendations
On the first login of the day, new Recommendations are requested and updates existing
